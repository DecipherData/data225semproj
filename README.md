# GET YOUR PERFECT FIT
Future of retail depends on giving customers the products which are best suited for them.There has been a
surge in online shopping since the onset of the pandemic. Leading brands have been witnessing the increase in their
online sales.People find online shopping more convenient and thus, online stores are keeping very limited stock in their
stores rather than websites as people can buy several clothes from all the available or newly launched outfits by
HM.Therefore, providing consumers with such an e-commerce platform that captures the wants of the customers has
become imperative. This project aims to suggest the customer their best possible outfit according to their body shape.
Although, filters are available that provide customers outfits based on various parameters such as price, size, colour,
and type. After evaluating the current HM Dataset, we came up with a plan to construct the architecture in such a way
that customers can save their time by just providing a few details such as their age, size, body shape, colour
preferences, skin tone, liking for specific fabrics while creating their accounts itself. Using these parameters users will be
able to see only those outfits which will be best suited to them. Also, will take into consideration if the customer is
suffering from any textile related skin condition to suggest clothes made from suitable fabrics.It will also evaluate various
other factors for gaining useful insights about the products
